## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

This challenge help me to improve in designing a responsive user interface, as it was difficult and fun having to put mobile devices in my flexbox and grid layout system.

I also learnt using Javascript to toggle the navigation bar which was very hectic at first, but i was able to get through it after series of debugging.

The Js part of this challenge excite me most.
### Continued development

If there's anything i will love to focus and developed now, it will be my Javascript skill.
